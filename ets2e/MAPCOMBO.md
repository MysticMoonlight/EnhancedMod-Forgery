# Starlight ETS2 Map Combos
Welcome to Starlight ETS2 Map Combos! We decided to share the map combo that we use.

We carefully cherry-picked map mods carefully to avoid any compatibility issue on future update of ETS2 and their mods.

We offer two following combos:
* Eurasia Combo
  * Vanilla Edition
  * Pro Edition
    * Pro Edition (Next Gen Preview)

## Recommended General Mod Orders
The general mod load orders should be the following:
* Map/Loading Background Mods
* UI Mods
* (Optional) [Realistic Rain](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787041596)
* (Optional) [Grimes Weather Mod](https://grimesmods.wordpress.com/)
* Sounds
* Graphics / Weather
* Others
* Physics
* Tuning Parts / Paintjobs
* (Optional) Traffic Density Mods
* AI / Traffic mods
* Trailers
* Trucks
* Maps

[We recommend you to use this mod collection as a base if you are unsure.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697485771)

## Recommended Background Map
Currently we support two mods: BenganJ's Ultimate Map Background Mod and DOWL's Afroeurasia Background mod. Both edition requires their own 'Crash Fix' Patch to avoid crashes when zooming.

* [BenganJ's Ultimate Map Background Mod](https://roextended.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20) is recommended for Vanilla Edition, since this combo uses default SCS map projection. Currently it supports 3 types of background mods: Satellite style, SCS style and Slim SCS style. Please note that this background mod does not support ProMods due to their own map projection. If you are using Pro Edition, use DOWL's mod instead.
* [DOWL's Afroeurasia Map Background Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialDOWL/myworkshopfiles?browsefilter=myfiles&sortmethod=creationorder&section=items&appid=227300&requiredtags%5B%5D=UI) is recommended for Pro Edition which uses ProMods. This mod can be used on both Vanilla and Pro Edition.
* (Windows ONLY, Optional) [Worlds Combined Background Map](https://truckymods.io/euro-truck-simulator-2/ui/worlds-combined-background-map) is recommended for Pro Edition which uses ProMods. This map is modified version of DOWL's Afroeurasia Background mod, and it has satellite style. This is not officially being supported by some ETS2 modding communities such as TerraMaps due to several reasons, but we will leave this mod as optional mod. This mod does NOT support OpenGL(Linux/macOS) due to usage of BC7 compressed textures and will have issue. This mod can be used on both Vanilla and Pro Edition.

## Eurasia Combo
### Vanilla Edition
Formerly known as Eurasia Classic, Vanilla Edition uses EuRoadNet as a base, and expands the map to Eurasia. It keeps vanilla atmosphere while improving the SCS map. Mod order referenced from [this post](https://www.roextended.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2229).

**Known issue:** Currently EuRoadNet does not support Special Transport DLC. Until they fix the issue related to Special Transport EuRoadNet mod will be marked as optional mod.

This edition features the following map mods: EuRoadNet, RusMap, JRR, TREXTENDED, Southern Region, The Great Steppe, Road to Asia, Corfu and Greek Islands, Rhodes, ROEXTENDED and AZGE (Optional) and more.

Formerly known as Eurasia, Pro Edition uses ProMods as a base. It has many contents compared with Eurasia Classic. Mod order referenced from [this post](https://terramaps.net/forum/threads/ets2-1-43-recommended-map-combo-by-terramaps.121/). (Thanks to Kobra2112 for the mod order)

### Pro Edition (Next Gen Preview)
> **News: An Update to Starlight ETS2 Eurasia Combo: Pro Edition (Long Announcement)**
> Hey fellow truckers! How are you doing?
> 
> Do you remember that we are no longer shifting focus into Pro Edition, which is based on ProMods? 
> 
> Originally we made decision to move focus to Vanilla Edition, because of following reasons:
> 1. ProMods does not use same SCS map projection and uses their own map projection, which has been criticism between BenganJ and ProMods team (More information can be found [here](https://roextended.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?p=18491#p18491))
> 
> 2. ProMods has been criticized from several map creators for invading their territories by adding a place that does already exists, and this is still happening. As a response Arayas and Sergey made a statement that they won't be providing Road Connection for ProMods anymore, but that problem was resolved as both Arayas and Sergey made decision to bring back road connection once again. (Arayas' response about their behavior can be read [here](https://www.roextended.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2015&start=450#p48472))
> 
> After long thinking about the decision we made before, we decided to consider ProMods as standalone mod. As a result, we will keep continue making improvement (Like we did on Vanilla Edition), but the Pro Edition will be restructured (Codenamed 'Next Gen Preview')on upcoming ETS2 1.44 release. 
> 
> You may experience following changes in the future:
> * ~~ROEX will completely be removed from map list.~~(April 26, 2022 update: ROEX will exist but it will be deprecated alongside RusMap in the future) Also RusMap will be deprecated someday if ProMods makes changes to Russia and Belarus once again (Until the RusMap is considered to be obsolete)
> * Southern Region map will be removed alongside with RusMap, as RusMap would be necessary.
> * This map combo will be considered independent - no more SCS things EXCEPT possible expansions that is compatible with ProMods but NOT RusMap/ROEX and their addon map mods
> * ~~About the missing content, TRExtended will remain to make up for ROEX mod's absense but will be removed if ProMods team completes whole Turkey area.~~(April 26, 2022 update: ROEX replaced TRExtended due to map background issue)
> 
> Another problem is the Heart of Russia DLC release. SCS Software officially [announced](https://www.vortex.cz/exkluzivne-heart-of-russia-pro-euro-truck-simulator-2-ted-nevyjde/) through Czech press that Heart of Russia will be delayed until ongoing war(Russia and Ukraine war) ends, so this plan can be changed at anytime (We will let you know when that happens)
>
> Happy Trucking!
>----
> Original announcement on [Mystic Moonlight Discord](https://discord.gg/WbXhYQkkzw) (Now deleted due to announcement channel changes)

This is another testing version of Pro Edition, which will be completely restructured on upcoming 1.44 release.

Using the fresh profile is recommnended due to major changes to the map.

Everything is explained on above announcement quotes, so there will be no more further explanations this time.

Please note that the content is still work-in-progress: maps included on the list can be changed at any time.
