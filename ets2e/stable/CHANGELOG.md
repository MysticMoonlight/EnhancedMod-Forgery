## Euro Truck Simulator 2: Enhanced 44.0 (Edinburgh) [May 13, 2022]
We are happy to announce the major update of Euro Truck Simulator 2: Enhanced 44.0 (Edinburgh)! This update mainly focused on cleanup and recreation from scratch.

Additionally, we apologize for the delay - our developer Roon had a headache due to his stressful day and Roon needed his break, so we made decision to delay the release to tomorrow. Also we want to thank you to everyone who waited patiently for this release! We hope you enjoy driving around the Europe!

Please note that mod developers are working hard to support 1.44. We want you to ask you to wait patiently rather than making them to rush, as many mod developers are busy.

### Features
* **Major refresh of mod list.** We announced that we are going on major cleanup and recreation from scratch in the past. And here they are! Unfortunately, this means directly upgrading to previous version is not supported. Method to upgrade will be explained later below.
* **Now most informations are markdown based.** Thanks to GitHub, we were able to use markdown documents powered by [GitHub](https://github.com). Now it has better organization, also allowing us to archive the past update history.
* **Now major update no longer follows official update release schedule.** As you seen in the Notice on our main page, starting from this version ETS2: Enhanced, ATS: Enhanced, Starlight no longer follows official release schedule. Compatibility update will be the part of minor update, and we will begin to follow our own release schedule from now on.

### How to upgrade to 44.0
