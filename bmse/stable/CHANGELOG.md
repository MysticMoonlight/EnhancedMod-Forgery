## Black Mesa: Enhanced 3.0 (Faceless Soldiers) [Mar 12, 2022]
It's been while since 2.0 update was released on December 2021...
After long winter hiatus, we are happy to announce the new version of Black Mesa: Enhanced 3.0 (Faceless Soldiers)!
We have recreated this mod collection from scratch to comply with [new standard](github.com/MysticMoonlight/EnhancedMod/blob/main/STANDARD.md) for EnhancedMod series.

### Highlights
* **Recreated this mod collection entirely from scratch, with Project Atomic**
* Reduced the mod that needs to be used with custom folder - Now you just need to find vpk file for 2 MBWS mod from workshop folder, then move the folder to 'bms/custom' folder!
* Heavily optimized the performance, now there will be less lags compared with 2.0
