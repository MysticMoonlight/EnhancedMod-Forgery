# Notice
Hello everyone,

We are sad to announce that this project will no longer be in development and will be discontinued.

There was several reasons behind these decisions:
* Lack of features to manage the mod collection (for example changelog feature is missing, so they won't know what was changed if we continue making changes)
* Steam Workshop forcing users to download by using Steam platform, making it Steam exclusive content which is against our standards and project vision
* Valve became hostile towards community and made steam workshop downloader tool shut down

The reason is mostly focused on Valve's behavior.

We want to say one thing to players using our modpack: If you think 'ease of use' is the best option, please consider thinking one more time. It was hell for making something using steam platform.

So unfortunately, this project will be discontinued and all mod collections will be private from now on.

# EnhancedMod Forgery
EnhancedMod Forgery is a group of Steam Workshop based modpack project developed by Mystic Moonlight and community contributors.

Initially this project started on June 16th, 2021 as a single modpack named Team Fortress 2 Enhanced.
Following that, we've continuously added improvements and expansions for more game support, and now we've consolidated it down to one massive project.

This repository is a compilation of modpacks we've made, so you can find them easily on one page.

EnhancedMod Forgery is one of fork from main EnhancedMod project due to Steam Workshop based works differently with manual installation of the project.
