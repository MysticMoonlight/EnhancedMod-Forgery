# EnhancedMod Forgery
EnhancedMod Forgery is a group of Steam Workshop based modpack project developed by Mystic Moonlight and community contributors.

Initially this project started on June 16th, 2021 as a single modpack named Team Fortress 2 Enhanced.
Following that, we've continuously added improvements and expansions for more game support, and now we've consolidated it down to one massive project.

This repository is a compilation of modpacks we've made, so you can find them easily on one page.

EnhancedMod Forgery is one of fork from main EnhancedMod project due to Steam Workshop based works differently with manual installation of the project.
